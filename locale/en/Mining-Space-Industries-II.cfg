page_Mining-Space-Industries-II_text_1=Your team has been contracted by Mining Space Industries (MSI) to execute a high-priority resource extraction operation on Nauvis, a planet located on the outer rim of explored space. The mission objective is clear: secure and extract valuable mineral assets for MSI operations.During final approach, the vessel experienced a critical systems failure, resulting in an unplanned and turbulent landing. While this incident presents operational challenges, the mission remains active and failure is not an acceptable outcome. Post-impact assessment revealed extensive damage. Recovery of the flight data recorder (black box) indicates that the ship's AI identified an imminent threat and autonomously activated emergency ejection protocols. Asset preservation was prioritized, with crew safety handled as a secondary measure—this decision will be escalated to MSI Corporate Review. The crew successfully evacuated via escape pods prior to the vessel's destruction. Although the majority of equipment was lost, preliminary scans suggest residual power can be salvaged from the wreckage. Immediate priority is to establish a provisional base of operations and begin situational analysis to resume mission parameters.

If you have 2 active military missions, no third military mission will be spawned until you accomplish the previous ones.

page_mission_name_M_research_msi_protomolecule_awaken=Holly crap! What in the name of Factorion just happened? Did David just get absorbed by that thing? What is going on? And what are those things attacking us ? They look like David! Is it being replicated ? What is going on?\n\nCareful, that thing looks instable. We should try to release David from that...\n\nWe need to undertand what happened. If we could research [technology=msi_protomolecule_awaken] this molecule sample on our laboratories we may discover how to deal with that threat.

The bad news is that the infection has spread so fast all around it and the thing is now everywhere! We need to research a way to fight the infection. So lets concentrate on developing a biological weapon to purge the threat for good. If we could launch it from a bomb on the the atmosphere, that could hit them all at once. We need to research the protomolecule antidote bomb [img=item/msi_protomolecule_antidote_bomb] and launch it on a rocket!
