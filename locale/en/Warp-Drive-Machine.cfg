They can be positive or negative. When two runes are combined on the chamber altars, the matching aspect amplifies, and that potion is shown on the middle of room. It is a result of the comparison of the big potion part of a rune and a small one from the other rune, both with the same color and signal. If two tablet have no matching aspects, they neutralize each other to make a neutral potion[img=wdm_rune_potion_gui_N]. When you get a potion result, you can make your deduction to help to decipher the mystery. Example: when two runes compared show a blue positive potion[img=wdm_rune_potion_gui_BP], you can deduce that those runes do NOT have a blue negative symbol, so you can eliminate possibilities from the tablet lists.\nTo prove your knowledge about the ancient runes, 3 random ancient potion tablets are shown on 3 altars. You have limited time to add the correct rune to each altar. At the end of the timer, if all 3 runes correspond correctly to each tablet, the mystery is solved and you will learn how to master the warp machine, unlocking the [technology=wdm_ship_win].
